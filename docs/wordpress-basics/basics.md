## Adding Style to Format Text

* You can **BOLD** and _ITALICIZE_ or underline text in a format very much like you would using Microsoft Word while working inside of WordPress.

!!! note
    If you prefer keyboard shortcuts you can highlight the text you'd like to apply basic styling to and use keyboard shortcuts. For example: Ctrl (Windows) or CMD (Mac OS) + B will apply bold formatting to highlighted text.
