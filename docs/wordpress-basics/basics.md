# WordPress Basics 

## Signing Into WordPress


## Uploading Media

Uploading new media to WordPress such as photos for use in posts, pages, and galleries can easily be completed via your WordPress Admin console.

* Login to WordPress Admin
* Click on **MEDIA**
* Click **ADD NEW**
* Navigate to the location on your computer where the photos are located and select them.
* Wait for your images to upload.

## Adding a Link


## Adding Style to Format Text

* You can **BOLD** and _ITALICIZE_ or underline text in a format very much like you would using Microsoft Word while working inside of WordPress.

!!! note
    If you prefer keyboard shortcuts you can highlight the text you'd like to apply basic styling to and use keyboard shortcuts. _For example: Ctrl (Windows) or CMD (Mac OS) + B will apply bold formatting to highlighted text._
