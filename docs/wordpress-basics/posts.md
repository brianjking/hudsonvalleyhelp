# WordPress Posts

WordPress sites are primarily comprised of a combination of **POSTS** and
**PAGES**.

## When To Use a Post Versus a Page

!!! tip
    The **POSTS** functionality should be used when you're adding news or another similar update. You will primarily be **EDITING PAGES** or **ADDING POSTS** as all pages should be already created during the initial site buildout.
