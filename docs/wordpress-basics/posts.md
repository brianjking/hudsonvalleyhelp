# WordPress Posts

WordPress sites are primarily comprised of a combination of **POSTS** and
**PAGES**.

## When To Use a Post Versus a Page

!!! tip
    The **POSTS** functionality should be used when you're adding news or another similar update. You will primarily be **EDITING PAGES** or **ADDING POSTS** as all pages should be already created during the initial site buildout. 


### Adding A New Post

* Access the WordPress Admin Dashboard
* Click on **POSTS** from the left hand menu.
* Click on **ADD NEW** 
* Enter a post title
* Type your post text into the box below.
* Save your post with the **PUBLISH** button
* Visit the website to confirm your post looks correct.
