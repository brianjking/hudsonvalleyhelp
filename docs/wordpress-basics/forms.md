The Hudson Valley DockDogs website uses two different methods for creating
forms inside of WordPress.

## Divi Forms

For basic contact forms the Hudson Valley DockDogs website uses the pre-built
form engine built into the
[Divi Framework](http://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/).

## Contact Form 7 & PayPal Forms

All forms that integrate with PayPal for accepting payments utilize
[Contact Form 7](http://contactform7.com/) with a 3rd party PayPal integration.



### Adding A New PayPal Form

* Login to WordPress Admin Dashboard
* Locate the **CONTACT** menu on the left hand side.
* Select **ADD NEW** or **DUPLICATE** an existing form, such as the **INDIVIDUAL PAYPAL MEMBERSHIP FORM**
* If you're creating a new form as opposed to duplicating a form you'll need to configure the PayPal details under the **PAYPAL** tab in the form creation area. 

!!! note
    To simplify the configuration it's likely best to **DUPLICATE** an existing form and then make your specific edits to copy of the original. 

### Editing an Existing PayPal Form

* Login to WordPress Admin Dashboard
* Locate the **CONTACT** menu on the left hand side
* Select **EDIT** under the name of the form you wish to edit
* Make appropriate edits
* Save the form

### Editing an Existing Divi Form (Non-PayPal Form)
